# PWA Setup Checklist

## ✅ Already Configured

1. **vite-plugin-pwa** - Installed and configured
2. **Manifest** - Configured in `vite.config.ts`
3. **Service Worker** - Auto-generated by vite-plugin-pwa
4. **Meta Tags** - Present in `index.html`

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Create PWA Icons

You need to create two icon files:
- `public/pwa-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `public/pwa-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

**Options to create icons:**

1. **Use an online tool:**
   - Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - Upload a square image (at least 512x512)
   - Download the generated icons

2. **Use an image editor:**
   - Create a square image (512x512 minimum)
   - Export as PNG at 192x192 and 512x512 sizes
   - Save to `public/` folder

3. **Use a simple placeholder (for testing):**
   - You can create a simple colored square for now
   - We can replace it with a proper icon later

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

The PWA is already configured with:
- **Name:** Timer
- **Short Name:** Timer
- **Theme Color:** #0d0d0d (dark)
- **Display Mode:** Standalone (opens like an app)
- **Start URL:** / (root)

### Step 3: Test Locally

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Preview the build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Test PWA features:**
   - Open `http://localhost:4173` in Chrome/Edge
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to "Application" tab
   - Check "Manifest" section (should show your app details)
   - Check "Service Workers" section (should show registered worker)
   - Look for install prompt in address bar

### Step 4: After Deployment

Once deployed to GitHub Pages:

1. **Visit your site:** `https://pythonidaer.github.io/vue-pwa-timer/`

2. **Install as PWA:**
   - Chrome/Edge: Look for install icon in address bar
   - Mobile: "Add to Home Screen" option

3. **Test offline:**
   - Install the PWA
   - Turn off internet
   - App should still work (cached)

## 🎨 Icon Design Tips

For a timer app, consider:
- A clock/timer icon
- Dark theme colors (matches your app)
- Simple, recognizable design
- Works well at small sizes (192x192)

- ✅ Offline support (service worker caches files)
- ✅ Installable (when icons are added)
- ✅ Standalone display (no browser UI)
- ✅ Dark theme
